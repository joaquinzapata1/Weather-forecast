# Weather-forecast
Weather forecast app

## Deployed to https://gentle-fjord-39622.herokuapp.com/

### To run it locally, paste the project into your xampp or wampp directory.

#### Just input a city name, and you should get a fancy widget displaying the current weather forecast for that location.

### List of requirements:

1. Build a webservice with PHP, to consume an external API.

2. Use AJAX to send requests to the webservice.

3. Process and render the results on the view.

#### The API I used: https://openweathermap.org/api

#### Mobile responsiveness to be added in the future.
